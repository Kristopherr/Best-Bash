# Best Bash
Best Bash is an attempt to create an entertaining and handsome bash.  
Currently requires figlet (for quotes on load and clear screen) and dig from dnsutils package (for IP address enum).
Installer will attemp to get required packages.

1) Download file InstallBestBash
2) chmod +x InstallBestBash
3) sudo ./InstallBestBash

"install gives option to restore original bash files."

Works in debian/ubuntu based distro. Any disto bash will work by replacing "/home/$USER/.bashrc" and/or "/root/.bashrc" file here with ones in distro and installing figlet and fortune.

Works!~
